# CSI-matrice-reconstruction-using-deep-autoencoders

In this project an autoencoder that compresses(encodes) the large CSI matrice of massive MIMO communication at user side and transmit this comprtessed matrice to the base station which is required for FDD duplexing scenarios is implemented. The CSI matrix are considered as sample images and a residual convolutional neural network is used to decode them.
